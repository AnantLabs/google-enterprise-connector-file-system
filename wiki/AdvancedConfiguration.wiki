= Introduction =
There are certain advanced properties that can change connector's behaviour. These propperties are not available on the configuration UI but they can be changed by editing connectorInstance.xml file which gets copied to every new connector that gets created. 
Following section explains purpose of each of these properties and enlists all the possible values along with default value for each of them.
Please note that these advanced properties in this form are available only in FS connector version 2.8 and above.

    <!--   
    Security level to be considered for fetching ACL for a file
    There are 4 possible values for this parameter. These are in the order of
    Stronger to weaker security levels.<br><br>
    FILEANDSHARE <br>
    SHARE <br>
    FILE <br>
    FILEORSHARE <br><br>
    Default value is 'FILEANDSHARE'  since it is the most restrictive of all
    4 scenarios.
    --><br>
    <!--
      <property name="aceSecurityLevel" value="FILEANDSHARE"/>
    -->
    
    <!-- 
    Flag to mark all crawled documents as 'public'.
    Please note that this property is tightly coupled with 'pushAclFlag' property.
    You cannot keep both these values true. So if you want documents to be sent as
    public, then you must mark 'pushAclFlag' as 'false' 
    -->
    <!--
    <property name="markDocumentPublicFlag" value="false"/>
    -->
    
    <!-- 
    Flag to reset the last access time of a SMB file after crawling.
    This should be used when the start path of the url starts with "smb://".
    -->
    <!--  
    <property name="lastAccessResetFlagForSmb" value="false"/>
    -->
    
    <!-- 
    Flag to reset the last access time of a local windows file after crawling.
    This should be used when the start path of the url is a windows 
    style file path. E.g. "c://share/data"
    -->
    <!-- 
    <property name="lastAccessResetFlagForLocalWindows" value="false"/>
    -->
    
    <!-- 
    This flag is to specify whether connector should send ACL information with
    each document to the GSA. If this is set to true, then connector will send
    security information for each file such as which users and groups hav access    to the file. This information will be used while serving the results to the users.     
    Please note that this property is tightly coupled with  'markDocumentPublicFlag' property.
    You cannot keep both these values true. So if you want to send ACL information with each file, then you must mark 'markDocumentPublicFlag' as 'false' 
    -->
    <!--
    <property name="pushAclFlag" value="true"/>

    <!-- 
    No. of milliseconds to sleep after a scan
    When this delay is applied depends on the 'introduceDelayAfterEveryScan'
    parameter described below.
    -->
    <!--
    <property name="delayBetweenTwoScansInMillis" value="60000"/>
    -->
  
    <!-- 
    Size of the queue that holds the changes detected by the file system
    connector. 
    -->
    <!--
    <property name="queueSize" value="1000"/>
    -->

    <!-- 
    Flag that decides whether to add delay after every scan or only after scan
    that results in no changes. 
    -->
    <!--
    <property name="introduceDelayAfterEveryScan" value="false"/>
    -->
  
    <!-- 
    Represents the format in which ACE entries should be fed to GSA for groups
    Possible values are
