Steps to install Google Enterprise Connector for File Systems

=Introduction=
This document walks you through the steps to manually install a connector. The instructions mentioned here are applicable to connector version 1.0.0_ALPHA and above

Google recommends that you use the installer for installing the connector. You may want to do it manually if,

  * You have built and installed a customized connector manager or a customized version of   the connector
  * You want to deploy the connector on an existing Tomcat installation
  * You are installing a patch release that is not packaged with an installer.

=Pre-requisites=
  * Apache Tomcat 6. You can download it from it from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi
  * JRE1.5 or above. Refer to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp for downloads

=Manual installation steps=
  # Shut down Tomcat if it is running.
  # Go to $CATALINA_HOME\bin directory.
    * For Windows edit *Add the following lines in the start of the file:
      {{{
      Add the following lines in the start of the file:
      set JRE_HOME=<JRE_HOME>
      set PATH=%PATH%;
   
      Add the following lines just before "rem Set standard command for invoking Java":
      rem Google Enterpise Connector Logging
      set CONNECTOR_LOGGING=%CATALINA_HOME%\webapps\connector-manager\WEB-INF\lib\connector-logging.jar
      if not exist "%CONNECTOR_LOGGING%" goto noConnectorLogging
      set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%CONNECTOR_LOGGING%
      :noConnectorLogging
      }}} 
    * For Linux edit *setclasspath.sh*
      {{{
      Add the following lines in the start of the file:
      export JRE_HOME=<JRE_HOME>
      export PATH="$PATH":"$JRE_HOME"/bin
     
      Add the following lines just before "# OSX hack to CLASSPATH":
      # Google Enterpise Connector Logging
      CONNECTOR_LOGGING="$CATALINA_HOME"/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib/connector-logging.jar
      if [ -f "$CONNECTOR_LOGGING ]; then
      CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH":"$CONNECTOR_LOGGING"
      fi

      }}}
      Please make sure that all the shell scripts (with ".sh" as extension) have execute permissions.
  # If you do not have the connector manager installed, follow these steps
    * Start a web browser and navigate to http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/downloads/list
    * Download the correct binary distribution compressed file for your platform
    * unpack the binary distribution
    * copy the connector-manager.war to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps directory
    * Start Tomcat so that the connector manager gets deployed. To confirm that the connector manager has been properly deployed under Tomcat confirm that a directory with the name connector-manager has been created under $CATALINA_HOME/webapps directory
Also you can check for http://localhost:8080/connector-manager/testConnectivity which will displays the connectivity status or http://localhost:8080/connector-manager/startUp which will display a message indicating the successful deployment of Connector Manager
    * Shut down the Tomcat to start with the further steps.
